## Files

- `main.cpp`: The main driver file that handles input, processes commands, and interacts with bank accounts and transactions.
- `bank_acc.h`: Defines the `BankAccount` class, which manages account balances and stores transaction history.
- `transactions.h`: Defines the `Transaction` class, which holds information about individual transactions.

## Compilation

To compile the source files, use the following command:
```bash
g++ -o bank_system.out main.cpp bank_acc.cpp transactions.cpp
